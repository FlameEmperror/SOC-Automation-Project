# SOC-Automation-Project
The SOC Automation Project aims to streamline security operations by automating the collection of alarms from Wazuh, creating tickets in TheHive, and notifying security engineers via email. This system reduces the need for continuous monitoring by integrating Shuffle, Wazuh, TheHive, and various other components.
Refer this step by step guide [Project Report](SOC.pdf) to follow the full process of setting up the SOC Lab.
